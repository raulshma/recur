# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive React Native mobile application that mirrors the functionality of the existing Recur subscription management system. The mobile app will provide users with full access to their subscription data, dashboard analytics, and management capabilities while maintaining the same design principles and performance standards as the web application. The app will utilize the existing .NET API backend and provide a native mobile experience optimized for iOS and Android platforms.
