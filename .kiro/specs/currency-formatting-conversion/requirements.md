# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive currency formatting and conversion functionality for the subscription management application. Users will see all monetary values displayed in their preferred currency format, with automatic conversion from subscription-specific currencies to the user's default currency. This ensures a consistent and localized experience while maintaining accurate financial tracking across different currencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all monetary values formatted according to my selected currency preferences, so that I can easily understand costs in my familiar currency format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any monetary value in the UI THEN the system SHALL display it using the proper currency symbol and formatting for their default currency
2. WHEN a user changes their default currency in settings THEN all monetary displays SHALL immediately update to reflect the new currency format
3. WHEN displaying currency amounts THEN the system SHALL use proper locale-specific formatting (decimal separators, thousand separators, symbol placement)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want subscriptions with different currencies to be converted to my default currency, so that I can compare costs and see accurate totals regardless of the original subscription currency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a subscription has a different currency than the user's default THEN the system SHALL convert the amount to the user's default currency for display
2. WHEN calculating dashboard statistics (total monthly cost, annual cost) THEN the system SHALL convert all subscription costs to the user's default currency before aggregation
3. WHEN displaying individual subscription costs THEN the system SHALL show both the original currency amount and the converted amount in the user's default currency
4. IF currency conversion rates are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display the original currency with a clear indicator that conversion is not available

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to maintain accurate currency conversion rates, so that the converted amounts reflect current market values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing currency conversions THEN the system SHALL use current exchange rates from a reliable source
2. WHEN exchange rates are updated THEN the system SHALL cache rates for reasonable periods to avoid excessive API calls
3. WHEN conversion fails or rates are stale THEN the system SHALL provide fallback behavior and clear user feedback
4. WHEN the same currency is used for both subscription and user default THEN the system SHALL skip conversion and display the original amount

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see currency information clearly indicated in the interface, so that I understand which amounts are converted and which are original.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a subscription amount is converted THEN the system SHALL provide visual indication that conversion has occurred
2. WHEN hovering over or interacting with converted amounts THEN the system SHALL show the original currency and amount
3. WHEN conversion rates are older than 24 hours THEN the system SHALL display a warning about potentially stale rates
4. WHEN displaying budget limits and comparisons THEN the system SHALL ensure all amounts are in the same currency for accurate comparison

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the system to handle currency operations efficiently, so that performance remains optimal even with many subscriptions in different currencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading dashboard data THEN the system SHALL batch currency conversions to minimize API calls
2. WHEN the same currency conversion is needed multiple times THEN the system SHALL reuse cached conversion rates
3. WHEN currency conversion fails THEN the system SHALL log errors appropriately without breaking the user experience
4. WHEN processing large numbers of subscriptions THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance for currency operations
